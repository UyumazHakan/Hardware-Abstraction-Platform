## Sensor Layer of  IoT Practical Course Project - TUM
This project contains different components to retrieve data from a wide variety of sensors that can be deployed with Raspberry PIs and Odroid devices. 

## Features
- Support for most of the sensors (NOT actuators, i.e. buttons etc.) in [SensorKit X40](http://sensorkit.en.joy-it.net/index.php?title=Main_Page)
- Support for [Odroid XU 4](https://www.odroid.co.uk/hardkernel-odroid-xu4) and its [weather board](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G140264897696)
- Modular & extensible architecture
- Configuration of devices and their sensors easily with the help of its web-server. [See](https://gitlab.lrz.de/IoT-Practicum-Group/sensors/tree/master/iot-web-server)
- Data transfer to [Layer 2](https://gitlab.lrz.de/IoT-Practicum-Group/data_layer)
